## Overview

**FinSight** is an interactive data dashboard that analyzes financial transaction data and detects fraudulent patterns in real time. 

Built using Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn, the app is designed to simulate how banks or fintech platforms monitor transaction health and flag anomalies.


This is part of my effort to showcase real-world data engineering and machine learning workflows with a finance twist.
